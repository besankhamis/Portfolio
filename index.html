      <h1>Abstraction / Freedom... The Reach</h1>
      <p>
        1)Shift: I shift reality slightly, into a realm of metaphor and the impossible.
        <br>
        2)*A fragile opening: This shift to the imaginary leaves a fragile opening between reality and fantasy
        <br>
        3)Reach: I reach inside, I grasp freedom.

        *The Fragile Opening

        (Existing in the Eyelash Moment)
      </h1>

        <span class="normal">Eyes open:</span> With eyes open I take what I see around me to be my concrete reality, however absurd a reality it may be.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="normal">Eyes closed:</span> strands of light + color, faces + figures float past. My surreal--or at least the surface of my surreal.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="normal">Blink:</span> Eyelash Moment
        <br>
        When I blink, for an instant, my concrete reality is obfuscated. But my eyes are not closed.
        <br>
        My eyelashes collide and create a haze, wherein those phosphenes of light, color, form (free shapes) are infused with the forms of my daily life. Reality is refreshed.
        <br>
        <br>
        It is not possible to freeze this moment, but through painting, sculpture, performance, and musical composition, I exist creatively in it.
