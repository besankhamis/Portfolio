          <span class="highlight">Besan Z. Khamis</span> (b. 1994) is a Palestinian-American artist living in New York City. He grew up in Baltimore, MD, where received his BFA in interdisciplinary sculpture from the Maryland Institute College of Art. His work consists of paintings, sculptures, performances, and musical compositions. He is currently working on multiple musical collaborations, and on a series of theatrical art performances called Bird’s Eye View of the Occupation. Concerned about the condition of the Palestinian people, Besan is focusing on the creation of a political artists’ movement that specifically addresses Palestinian grievances.

      <h1>Abstraction / Freedom... The Reach</h1>
      <p>
        1) Shift: I shift reality slightly, into a realm of metaphor and the impossible.
        <br>
        2)*A fragile opening: This shift to the imaginary leaves a fragile opening between reality and fantasy
        <br>
        3)Reach: I reach inside, I grasp freedom.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1>
        * The Fragile Opening 
        <br>
        (Existing in the Eyelash Moment)
      </h1>
      <p>
        <span class="normal">Eyes open:</span> With eyes open I take what I see around me to be my concrete reality, however absurd a reality it may be.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="normal">Eyes closed:</span> strands of light + color, faces + figures float past. My surreal--or at least the surface of my surreal.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="normal">Blink:</span> Eyelash Moment
        <br>
        When I blink, for an instant, my concrete reality is obfuscated. But my eyes are not closed.
        <br>
        My eyelashes collide and create a haze, wherein those phosphenes of light, color, form (free shapes) are infused with the forms of my daily life. Reality is refreshed.
        <br>
        <br>
        It is not possible to freeze this moment, but through painting, sculpture, performance, and musical composition, I exist creatively in it.
